## Frontend

The project includes two user-facing frontend components:

### 1. Web Interface

A simple web interface is provided to interact with the Gemini-powered email reply generator.

- Built using: React
- It communicates with the Spring Boot backend to generate replies.
- Hosted version: https://emailreplygenerator.web.app/

> Users do not need to configure anything â€” the backend is already connected to a valid Gemini API key.

### 2. Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension allows users to generate AI-powered replies directly inside their email inbox.

- Code location: `frontend/chromeExtension/`
- The extension can be downloaded as a `.zip` file from the website or directly from the repo.
- After that, you will get a new `Generate Reply` button when you reply to an email
- Now you can generate a reply in a single click directly from gmail.

## Backend

The backend is built with Spring Boot and is responsible for:

- Accepting email content from the frontend or extension.
- Calling the Gemini API with the email content with api key set as env variable.
- Returning the generated reply to the client.

### Configuration

The backend is configured to use a Gemini API key via environment variables. The deployed version is already connected to a working key, so users do not need to configure anything to use the web interface or Chrome extension.

> **Important Notice**
>
> This project uses the Gemini API and is currently preconfigured with a demo API key for demonstration purposes only.
>
> For **personal use**, it is **strongly recommended** to host your own backend and configure it with **your own Gemini API key**. This ensures:
> - Better security and privacy
> - Full control over rate limits
> - Compliance with Gemini's usage policies
>
> **Note:** For simplicity, this version does not prompt users to enter their own API key. You can modify the configuration to support custom key input if needed.
